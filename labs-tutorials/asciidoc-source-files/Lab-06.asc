= Lab 6.0 â€“ Application Lifecycle

== Objective
By the time this lab is complete, our Yamba app will implement various lifecycle methods.

== Overview
In this lab, we will cover the following concepts:

* Creating an additional dialog while posting status update

* Implementing a progress dialog

* Demonstrating usage of +onPreExecute+

* Implementing a cancellable dialog

* Demonstrating usage of +onPostExecute+

* Demonstrating +onStop+ to force stop our asynchronous task when the app shuts down

== Setup
Lab 5.0 has been completed. 

== Steps
. Implement an "add" dialog to appear while posting status update.
. Implement a progress dialog.
+
NOTE: The Progress Dialog implements +onPreExecute+ .

. Implement a cancellable dialog.
+
NOTE:  The cancellable dialog uses +onPostExecute+ .

. Implement +onStop+ functionality to force stop your asynchronous task when your app closes.
